Screenshot of the first screen. The two buttons, one it is used to reset and clean the input and the other to confirm user's input. It accepts only number form 1020 to 1029.

If the input value is invalid, an alert will be shown to the user with a button to reset the input. 

## Install and Use

In order to install, clone this repository and run:

> npm install  
//OR  
>yarn install

This was made with Expo, so you need it to run. To do it, run:
> npm start  
 //OR  
> npm expo start --tunnel

This starts the Metro Bundler. You can simulate the app in an Android emulator (such as in Android Studio) or in your own device, Android or iOS powered, by downloading the Expo App.
